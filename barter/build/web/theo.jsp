        <h1>Why we Need a New Exchange System</h1>
        <h4>
            <p>
               Because our conventional money-based exchange system is at the root of most of the misery, suffering and problems faced by humanity. It is also the prime factor behind the environmental crises we face.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The money systems we use are not neutral, non-partisan, services provided by our governments. They are a ‘service’ provided by private financial institutions (banks) specifically for their own benefit rather than those who use them. Our conventional money systems only work for those who already have money and marginalise the rest. They are also the fuel that powers the growth imperative of our economies, forcing us all to compete and having disastrous consequences for the health of our planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main problem with conventional money is that it ‘exists’, or at least we are encouraged by the commercial banks to believe that it exists so that they can continue to ‘lend’ it to us at a price! As such it has to be created, distributed and the amount of it restricted and controlled. As money comes into existence when commercial banks grant loans, every unit in existence is based on a unit of debt. This determines the quantity of money, which has nothing to do with the amount of money people require to live decent lives. Such money is also based on speculation, because it is loaned into existence on the premise that it will be paid back in the future with interest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite its modern electronic trappings, our conventional money systems are a relic of history. They are the latter day equivalent of cattle or gold. The debt-based money system was developed for the industrial revolution to provide a rapidly expanding money supply that could not be provided by a money system based on the quantity of precious metals. This introduced intangible money that did not exist in the same way as earlier ‘hard’ monies, but people continued treating it as a tradable commodity. Money that ‘exists’ can thus be accumulated like any other commodity. It can also be stolen, traded, collected, destroyed and lost. Its distribution is not based on the delivery of value to others but on the ability of people to ‘make money’. Conventional money has no restraints and always flows away from where it is created and needed, towards the ‘money centres’.

        <h1>The Problems with Conventional Money</h1>
        <h4>
            As an exchange system, money fails on many counts…
        </h4>
        <h2>1. It is partisan</h2>
        <h4>
            Money as we know it is not a neutral service provided by the government. Our money supply is created by private financial institutions on a for-profit basis. The money-based exchange system is privately owned and run as a profit-making business designed to benefit those who provide it, not those who use it.
        </h4>
        <h2>
            2. It is based on debt
        </h2>
        <h4>
            Money is created when banks grant loans. Thus for every unit created there is one unit of debt.
        </h4>
        <h2>
            3. We are encouraged to think of it as a ‘thing’ 
        </h2>
        <h4>
            Money is essentially information and today has no physical existence, yet banks encourage us to think of it as a ‘thing’ so that they can ‘lend’ it to us and thereby make a profit by charging interest. ‘Thing’ money also has to be created, distributed and controlled so that there is not too much or too little of it. It can also be stolen, lost, bought, sold, gambled and counterfeited, with serious consequences for everyone.
        </h4>
        <h2>
            It causes cancerous growth
        </h2>
        <h4>
            Banks continuously need to create more money than is required to pay back their loans so that borrowers can pay back the interest on those loans as well. This is the source of the growth imperative of our economies. There must be a continual expansion of bank credit or else the economy goes into recession. Infinite growth in a finite world is an impossibility and is the direct cause of the environmental problems we now all face.

            Advantages of the Barter Exchange(BE) :
        </h1>
        <h4>
            Here are some of the advantages of the using the Barter Exchange System<br><br>
            1.  It provides a parallel stream of income and so reduces our dependence on money<br><br>
            2.  It bridges the ‘money gap’ between the skills/offers/talents/gifts of providers and the wants/needs that we all have. Conventional money usually can’t bridge this gap because its supply is limited or non-existent.<br><br>
            3.  It builds community by creating links with those around us who can help satisfy our requirements<br><br>
            4.  BE provides a range of exchange options: time exchange, swaps, barter, gifting, sharing, time banking, metric currencies, virtual currencies<br><br>
            5.  BE metric currencies measure and so can never be in short supply like conventional issued, circulating currencies<br><br>
            6.  It is democratic: it returns the ‘money power’ to the people<br><br>
            7.  It allocates credit democratically<br><br>
            8.  It eliminates usury. Its money is ‘free’ (i.e. interest free)<br><br>
            9.  It keeps wealth where it is created<br><br>
            10. It eliminates cheating, theft and fraud (of money)<br><br>
            11. It provides a support network<br><br>
            12. It eliminates the problem of providers not being paid for what they supply<br><br>
            13. It reconciles the accounts of providers and recipients immediately<br><br>
            14. It promotes honesty because one can never ‘run out of money’<br><br>
