    we need. ‘Money‘ is just one of them; ‘Money’ is another. The internet <br>
    unnecessary step of acquiring money first. At CES we exchange and share <br>
    what we have to offer for what others provide, using a variety of exchange <br>

    the apparatus required to create, circulate and manage them. This helps us <br>
    focus on providing and requesting what is really needed instead of chasing <br>
    after money.
