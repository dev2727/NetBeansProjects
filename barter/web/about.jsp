         <h1>What Is Barter Exchange</h1>
             <h4>
                 <p> <br>
                The <h3>Barter Exchange</h3> is a community-based exchange system that provides the means for communities to trade and exchange their goods and services, both locally and remotely. It could also be described as a global complementary trading network that operates without money as it is commonly understood.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike the conventional money-based exchange system, the CES has no physical currency. The idea that such a currency is necessary before any trading can take place is an ancient one and increasingly irrelevant in this day and age of computers and the Internet. Information can replace currencies and at the same time eliminate most of the problems associated with regular money.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, the Barter Exchange provides a range of exchange methods for exchanging goods and services:<i> record keeping, organised bartering, swapping, gifting and sharing</i>. This allows users to find the appropriate way to exchange what they have to offer, all without using regular money.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many similar trading systems around the world, commonly know as <b>Community Exchange Systems, Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS), Mutual Credit trading systems, Clearing Circles, Trade Exchanges or Time Banks</b>. These all use <i>metric currencies</i>– currencies that measure as opposed to the<i> issued currencies</i> of conventional money-based exchange systems
            </p>
            <p>
                As metric currencies are information they do not have to be ‘created’ like conventional money so there is no need for an issuing authority or for a supply of it, and none is required to start trading. ‘Money’ in these systems is a retrospective score-keeping that keeps a record of who did what for whom and who provided what to whom. There can never be a shortage of information as there can of money, as information does not have to be created and limited by a third party (banks or government) in order to give it value and meaning. For this reason the concepts of borrowing, lending and interest are meaningless in the CES.
